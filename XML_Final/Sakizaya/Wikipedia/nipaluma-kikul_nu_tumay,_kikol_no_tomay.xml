Sansevieria trifasciata is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to tropical West Africa from Nigeria east to the Congo. It is most commonly known as the snake plant, mother-in-law's tongue, and viper's bowstring hemp, among other names.It is an evergreen perennial plant forming dense stands, spreading by way of its creeping rhizome, which is sometimes above ground, sometimes underground. Its stiff leaves grow vertically from a basal rosette. Mature leaves are dark green with light gray-green cross-banding and usually range between 70-90 centimetres (28-35 in) long and 5-6 centimetres (2.0-2.4 in) wide, though it can reach heights above 2 m (6 ft) in optimal conditions.[citation needed]The specific epithet trifasciata means &quot;three bundles&quot;.
